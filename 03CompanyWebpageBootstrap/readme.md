# Web Page for a Company

This project is a redesign and improvement of the [CompanyWebpageCSS](https://github.com/Tahsintok/WebDevPracticeFiles/blob/main/CompanyWebpageCSS/readme.md), utilizing Bootstrap to enhance the structure and layout. The focus of the project is to practice and implement Bootstrap's fundamental layout features, including:

* **Breakpoints** : Responsive design adjustments for different screen sizes.
* **Container System** : Efficient content alignment and spacing.
* **Grid Structure**: Flexibility in organizing page elements within a 12-column layout.

Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience with these core Bootstrap features while rebuilding a professional company webpage layout.

## Page Overview
All pages consist of a responsive navbar, main container, and footer to structure the webpage.
