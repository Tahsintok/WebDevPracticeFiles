# Menu Display and Filtering Project

This project is a dynamic web application that showcases a restaurant menu and allows users to filter menu items by category using buttons. The project demonstrates key development concepts,including:

- **Array Methods**: Utilized methods like map() and filter() to dynamically create unique category buttons and filter menu items based on user selection.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Leveraged JavaScript to create and append HTML elements, displaying menu items and buttons directly in the document.
- **Event Handling**: Implemented onclick event listeners for the buttons to enable real-time filtering of menu items.
